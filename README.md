# Wetland Detection and Mapping using Python API

## üåç Project Overview
Wetlands are complex and dynamic ecosystems that are often partially covered by vegetation, making it challenging to delineate water bodies using standard water indices. This project presents a method for wetland mapping and waterbody extraction using Landsat 8 SR imagery and spectral band-based thresholding, implemented through the xee and geemap Python APIs.

The analysis was performed over Vankalai Wetland, a Ramsar site in the Mannar District, Sri Lanka.

## üîç Key Objective
Use band thresholding (NIR & SWIR2) to improve delineation of wetland water bodies, especially under vegetative cover.

## üß† Methodology
1. Data Preparation
- Load Landsat 8 SR imagery for 2020‚Äì2024 over a user-drawn roi (Region of Interest).
- Filter by cloud cover < 45%.
- Compute mean composite.

2. Scaling Surface Reflectance
    #### Landsat SR values are scaled:

3. Vegetation and Water Indices
NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)
‚Üí Indicates vegetation cover.

NDWI = (GREEN - NIR) / (GREEN + NIR)
‚Üí Helps identify surface water but may struggle in vegetated wetlands.

4. Wetland Water Delineation via Spectral Thresholding
- Many wetlands are missed by NDWI due to vegetation.
- Pixels are classified as potential wetland water when:
    NIR ‚â§ 0.1735
    SWIR2 ‚â§ 0.1035

Two logic modes tested:
- AND condition: High confidence in water detection.
- OR condition: Broader detection, potentially including more shallow/vegetated water.

## üìå Notes
- Although this method was applied to wetlands, the band-thresholding logic can be adapted to any land cover type for water detection.
- You can refine thresholds or add SAVI, MNDWI for more complex scenes.
- Landsat‚Äôs 30m resolution is suitable for medium-scale wetlands; Sentinel-2 or SAR could improve results for narrow or fragmented wetlands.
